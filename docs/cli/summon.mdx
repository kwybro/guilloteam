```sh
guillo summon <email>                   # invite to locked team
guillo summon <email> --team <team-id>  # invite to a specific team

guillo team invites                     # list pending invites (owner only)
guillo team invites revoke <invite-id>  # revoke an invite

guillo team join <token>                # accept an invite
```

Invite tokens expire after 7 days. Re-summoning the same email replaces the existing invite.
