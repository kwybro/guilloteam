title: guillo lock
description: Pin a working context so you don't pass IDs on every command.
---

```sh
guillo lock                    # show current context
guillo lock team <team-id>     # set active team (clears active project)
guillo lock project <id>       # set active project (implicitly sets team)
guillo unlock                  # clear all context
```

Context is stored in `~/.guilloteam/.env` and can be overridden per-command with `--team` and `--project` flags.
