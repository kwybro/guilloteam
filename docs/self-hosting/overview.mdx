<Note>Self-hosting documentation is coming soon.</Note>

guilloteam is designed to be self-hostable. The API is a standard Hono app that runs anywhere Bun or Node.js runs, and the database is libSQL-compatible (Turso or self-hosted `sqld`).

Point the CLI at your instance:

```sh
guillo config set api-url https://your-instance.com
```
