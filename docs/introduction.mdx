title: Introduction
description: guilloteam is a terminal-native task management tool built for dev teams.
---

**guilloteam** gives your team a shared workspace for projects and tasks, controlled entirely from the command line via the `guillo` CLI.

## Key concepts

- **Teams** — the top-level unit. Every account gets a Personal team on signup.
- **Projects** — scoped to a team. Group related work together.
- **Tasks** — scoped to a project. Status: `open → in_progress → executed`.
- **Lock** — pin a team and project as your working context so you don't pass IDs on every command.

## Quick example

```sh
guillo auth register
guillo lock project proj_abc123
guillo tasks create "Ship the landing page"
guillo execute task_xyz789
```
