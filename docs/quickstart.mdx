Enter your email. You'll receive a verification code, then your API key is written to `~/.guilloteam/.env` automatically.

## 3. Create a project

```sh
guillo teams list
guillo lock team <team-id>
guillo projects create "My First Project"
guillo lock project <project-id>
```

## 4. Create and execute a task

guillo tasks create "Ship it"
guillo tasks list
guillo execute <task-id>
```

That's it. The blade has fallen.
