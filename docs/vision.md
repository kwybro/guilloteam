# Guilloteam Vision: Work in Public

## Core Idea

An opt-in public layer on top of guilloteam that lets teams broadcast their work activity — with scrambled, anonymized data — in the spirit of the "work in public" movement.

## How It Works

- Teams opt in to share a public feed of their activity
- Sensitive data (team names, project names, task titles) is scrambled/anonymized
- What's visible: patterns, velocity, progress — not specifics
- Think contribution graphs and activity feeds, not raw task data

## Use Cases

- **Within an org:** Teams see each other's momentum without micromanagement
- **Cross-org:** Open-source projects, indie hackers, or companies in the same space share energy and inspiration
- **Public garden:** A stylized, abstracted view of work output — motivating, low-fidelity, fun

## Why Guilloteam Is Well-Positioned

- API-first: a public read-only feed is just another endpoint
- Minimal data model: small anonymization surface (team, project, task names)
